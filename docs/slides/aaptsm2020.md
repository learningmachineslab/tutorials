### What do we use Machine Learning for?

* Modeling assessment data
  * Finding structure in assessment data
* Modeling student degree attainment
  * Determining factors that influence attainment
* Modeling graduate admissions
  * Determining factors that predict admissions
* Developing language models of papers
  * Extracting themes from a paper collection

</section>

### Today's workshop:

* Short introduction to the ML paradigm
* Guided tutorial to read, plot, analyze assessment data
* Comparative analysis using ML regression methods

</section>

<section data-markdown>

### Today's goals:

1. Develop a preliminary understanding of different ways to explore data using the ```pandas``` and ```matplotlib``` libraries
2. Become familiar with the ```model->train->score``` paradigm of ```sklearn```
3. Develop a preliminary understanding of the code implementations of ```sklearn``` for regression models
4. Develop a preliminary understanding of how to evaluate these models.

### What does Machine Learning buy us (as education researchers)?

* Data we have access to is increasingly complex, large, and fundamentally relational
* Models from data science are able to handle a wider variety of data and predictions
* Data science frameworks for model construction, development, validation, and comparison are robust
* We can ask and answer new research questions

*Caveats: ML is not always the right tool for the jobâ€¨
Interpreting results from ML models can be a challenge*

### Exploring Data Tutorial

We have collected assessment scores from students on a mechanics concept inventory.

For this tutorial, we will guide you through reading in, plotting, and deciding on research questions.

### Regression Tutorial

With the same assessment scores, we will determine what factors contribute most in a model that predicts those scores.

We will also evaluate different models to try to understand how robust our findings are.
